# Reikai
Reikai (originated from japanese - 霊界, meaning *spiritual world*) is a library for the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language. This library is inspired by [φ-calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13384), and it's main purpose is to bring [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) to the language.
